# Etheria
`Etheria` is set to become an essential tool for reverse engineering, security analysis, and Web3.0 development, offering a powerful yet user-friendly disassembly experience support `x86` `x86-64` `ARM` `ARM64` `MISC`.With its comprehensive feature set, including support for `WebAssembly` and `smart contracts`, a pure C API, Rust bindings, and web application compatibility, `Etheria` will empower users to understand and interact with executable code and blockchain applications like never before.
`Etheria` is a powerfull and ligthweight library common used by Reverse Engineer also include a custom CLI and Web platforms. 

1. **Comprehensive Instruction Set Support**
	1. Support for multiple architectures including `x86` `x86-64` `ARM` `ARM64`
	2. Regular updates to include the latest instruction sets and opcodes.
2. **WebAssembly and Smart Contract Analysis**:
	1. Disassembly and decompilation of WebAssembly (`Wasm`) modules.
	2. Support for analyzing `smart contracts` on platforms such as `Ethereum`, `Solana`, and more.
	3. Tools to facilitate auditing and security analysis of Web3.0 applications.
3.  **User-Friendly Interface**:
	1. Pure `C` API for integration with various programming languages and environments.
	2. `Rust` Bindings for seamless integration with `Rust` applications.
	3. Compilation with `WebAssembly` to enable usage within web Applications.
4. **Performance and Efficiency**:
	1. Highly optimized for speed and low memory usage. (`dynamic memory allocation` is `forbiden` and `must` be `forget`)
	2. Capable of handling large binaries and `WebAssembly` modules efficiently.
5. **Extensibility**
	1. Plugin architecture allowing users to extend functionnality.
	2. Support for custom scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
6. **Cross-Platform Compatibily**:
	1. The project is build with `meson`.
	2. Available for major operating systems including Windows, macOS, Linux.
	3. No LIBC Dependencies or extern library dependencies.
	4. WebAssembly compilation to support web-based applications.
7. **Detailed Documentation and Community Support**:
	1. Comprehensive documentation for users and developers.
	2. Active Community on github, discord and support channels.
